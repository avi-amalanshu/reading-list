# Welcome to Avi's reading-list!
I'm Avi Amalanshu, an incoming MS in ML student at CMU and former 5 year B.Tech + M.Tech student at [IIT-KGP](https://iitkgp.ac.in). I'm interested in representaiton learning, particularly pertaining to higher-order reasoning and symbolic execution. [Check out my website to learn more](https://avi-amalanshu.github.io).
## About This:
Right now, this thing is documenting my summer readings. For the past few years, I've saved a bunch of blogs, papers and texts that I found intriguing but didn't immediataely have the time to do justice to. This is probably the last time in the forseeable future that I can read whatever I want out of my own curiosity, so I plan on clearing out that backlog.

I also want to hit the ground running with my coursework at CMU this Fall. So I will read as close to that material as my whimsies permit. And revise some basics.

Use the sidebar to navigate. Happy reading!
