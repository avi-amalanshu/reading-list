# Welcome
## About Me:
I'm Avi Amalanshu, a 5th year undergraduate student (B.Tech + M.Tech dual degree) at IIT Kharagpur. These days, I'm doing research on 
Neurosymbolic Learning and MLSys. [Check out my website to learn more about me](https://avi-amalanshu.github.io).

## About This:
This is going to contain two things:
1. My recommendations 
2. My own personal reading list

across anything you can read:
* Textbooks (organized by broad area)
* Novels (including non-academic works)
  * I have lost the habit of reading over the past few years and I'm trying to start again. So most of this is a to-read for now.
* Conference proceedings (mainly intended as a recording of my reading notes/summaries)
* Individual Research Papers 
* Monographs
