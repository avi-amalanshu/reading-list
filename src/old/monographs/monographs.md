# Monographs
I love monographs because you can basically inhale one in a single evening and be ready to put in work the next morning.
Here are some monographs + other short texts that I found useful in various categories:
* [Machine Learning](./ml.md)
* [Systems](./sys.md)
* [Programming](./prog.md)
